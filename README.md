# Predicting-with-Linear-Regression

## Statement of the problem
According to the given wine indicators, predict points depending on the description, price, region, and various parameters.

## Dataset
In my research, I used a dataset from the Kaggle platform. In the dataset for each product, its description, price, and place of production, are stored origin, sort, and other parameters.

## Training the Model
The data were divided into training and testing in a ratio of 7:3. Linear Regression model and a Decision tree were trained using the Scikit-learn library.

## Results
Average Linear Regression accuracy = 98.6%

Average Decision Tree accuracy = 98.8%

## Conclusion
With the use of decision trees and linear regression, I got two models with sufficiently high accuracy.

## Software

Python, Scikit-learn library, NumPy, Pandas
